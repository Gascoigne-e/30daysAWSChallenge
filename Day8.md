# AWS 30-Day Challenge - Day 8

## Overview

On Day 8, I continued my Linux journey by diving into system information commands, SSH, navigation, and working with files and directories. I also learned how to find files and directories using various Linux commands. These are foundational skills for managing a Linux system, crucial for both development and cloud-related tasks.

## System Information Commands

- **whoami:** Displays the current username.
- **id:** Shows the user and group IDs for the current user.
- **hostname:** Outputs the name of the host system.
- **uname:** Provides system information, such as the OS name and kernel version.
- **pwd:** Prints the current working directory.
- **ifconfig:** Displays network interfaces and their configurations.
- **ip:** Shows IP addresses and network interfaces.
- **netstat:** Lists network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
- **ss:** Another tool to display network connections, focusing on socket statistics.
- **ps:** Displays currently running processes.
- **who:** Lists logged-in users.
- **env:** Displays environment variables.
- **lsblk:** Lists information about all available block devices.
- **lsusb:** Shows details of USB devices connected to the system.
- **lsof:** Lists open files and the processes using them.
- **lspci:** Provides details about PCI devices connected to the system.

## SSH (Secure Shell)

- **SSH:** A protocol for securely connecting to a remote machine over a network. It's essential for managing servers and working with cloud environments. I practiced setting up and using SSH for secure remote access.

## Navigation

- **Navigation:** Improved my ability to move around the Linux file system using commands like `cd` (change directory), `ls` (list files and directories), and `pwd` (print working directory).

## Working with Files and Directories

- **touch:** Creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.
- **mkdir:** Creates a new directory.
- **mv:** Moves or renames files and directories.
- **cp:** Copies files and directories from one location to another.

## Finding Files and Directories

- **which:** Locates the path of a command.
- **find:** Searches for files and directories within a directory hierarchy based on criteria like name, size, or modification date.
- **locate:** Quickly finds files by searching through a prebuilt database of file paths.

## Key Takeaways

- Learning these system information commands has given me greater control over and insight into the system I'm working on.
- SSH is a critical tool for remote system management, especially in cloud environments.
- Efficient navigation and file management are essential for productivity in a Linux environment.
- Knowing how to find files and directories quickly saves time and helps maintain an organized system.
